    <p style="font-size:110%" id="text";>&emsp;The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, was a war that took place from Nov 1, 1955 to Apr 30, 1975.
    There were two belligerent sides: the communist North Vietnamese Army and the southern Republic of Vietnam government. The Việt Cộng 
    were a guerilla communist rebel force in the south supported by North Vietnam, and were infamous for their elaborate tunnel systems 
    and deadly traps. The war itself is considered by many historians to be an offshoot of the Cold War between the USSR and the USA, as 
    the communist forces were supported by the USSR and the South Vietnamese by the US and many other western countries. The US at the 
    time considered their involvement in the war to be the liberation of Vietnam from dangerous communist ideals, and communist nations 
    saw the war as another people's rebellion against the state. The war is known for its heavy casualties, with 284,668–377,311 dead and 
    more than 1,340,000 wounded. There were also a great number of atrocities and war crimes commited by both sides against one another. 
    A notable example is the My Lai massacre by the allies, in which up to 504 innocent civilians were raped, murdered and mutilated by 
    two battalions. In the end, only one commander was ever charged with a crime. The Việt Cộng commited the Đắk Sơn Massacre, where 
    252 civilians had their homes torched and were burnt to death with flamethrowers.
