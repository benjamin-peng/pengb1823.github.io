      <p>&emsp;After the unification of the Nguyen dynasty in 19th, there was an effor made by the 
      emperor to expel French Catholic missionaries from Vietnam. The French responded when Napoleon the Third issued an order to 
      attack the imperial port of Đà Nẵng. Over time, the French forced the Vietnamese to cede a majority of their land as 
      French territory.</p>
      <p>&emsp;Tensions rose for almost a century, coming to a conclusion in the massive First Indochina War from 1946 
      to 1954. This was a war with a northern communist resistance force backed by China and the USSR against the imperialist
      French government. In the end, the French were driven almost completelyout of Indochina. However, the newly independent
      North Vietnam adopted a socialist ideology and refused to join with the south. The two conflicting countries and ideologies
      would clash for another few decades, finally culminating in the Vietnam War.</p>
