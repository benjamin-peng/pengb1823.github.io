      <p>&emsp;In 1975, the North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng finally began their final march on the weakened Southern forces. 
      Known as the Spring Offensive, the allied communist forces pushed their way through the coasts and hills of Vietnam until finally 
      reaching the southern capital of Saigon. It had been predicted for years that the city would not hold up; however, the imminent 
      forces caused a panic in the capital. The United States begin to organize forces to evacuate American citizens away from the city. 
      However, the roads were quickly destroyed by shelling. Helicopter evacuation became the only, albiet still dangerous, option.</p>
      <p>&emsp;The US set into plan their evactuation plan, known as Operation: Frequent Wind. Helicopters landed on rooftops and evacuated both 
      Americans and allied Vietnamese officials to aircraft carriers waiting offshore. Finally, on the Thirtieth of April, the North 
      Vietnamese Army found the south's army stronghold, tore down Saigon's government, and ended the Vietnamese War.</p>
