      <p>&emsp;After the North began to grow in power and sponser communist rebels from the South, the United States began its involvement 
      in the war starting in 1961 with president John F. Kennedy's escalation plan. Part of this plan included the endorsement of 
      Ngô Đình Diệm, the Prime Minister of the South. However, it was obvious that the only reason for Diệm's endoresment was because he 
      was the only leader in the region opposing communism. This became apparent as the South Vietnamese lost battle after battle against 
      the poorly equipped geurilla forces of the Việt Cộng, despite almost always having superior numbers. Diệm's ineptitude peaked in 
      Battle of Ấp Bắc.</p>

        <tr>
          <td>Over 200 Vietnamese and Americans wounded and dead, 5 helicopters shot down</td>
          <td>18 dead, 39 wounded</td>

    <p>&emsp;The US, realizing their mistake, organized a CIA-sponsored coup in which Diệm was murdered. After President Kennedy himself was 
    assasinated, Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn into office. He initially oppposed further involvement in the war. However, on August 2, 1964, 
    US cruisers in the Vietnamese Bay of Tonkin were shot down. This led to the signing of the Bay of Tonkin resolution, which gave the US 
    the right to become officially involved in the ground war.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The war so for had relatively high American approval. However, in January of 1968, the North Vietnamese launched the Tet Offensive, 
    a suprise attack on American and Southern forces. There were three phases, lasting from January to March. In the end, hundereds of
    thousands of Americans were massacred. Approval of the war in the US plummeted, pressuring Johnson to withdraw from the war. Thus, 
    he began the process of "Vietnamization", or withdrawing US troops and training South Vietnamese troops to be more effective. This would
    lead to the South's downfall.</p>
